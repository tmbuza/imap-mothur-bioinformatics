# (PART) GETTING STARTED {-}
# Getting started with Mothur pipeline

## Create a `mothur` YAML file 

```bash
name: mothur48
channels:
    - conda-forge
    - bioconda
    - defaults
dependencies:
    - mothur =1.48.0
    - vsearch =2.22.1
```

## Create `mothur` env using the YAML file
```bash
conda activate base
conda env create -n mothur48 --file mothur48.yml
conda activate mothur48 
```

## Download references databases
- Download Silva alignment reference database.
- Creatge Silva classifier from Silva alignments.
- Download RDP classifier.

```bash
bash workflow/scripts/mothurReferences.sh
```

## Overview of Mothur classification methods
There are four methods that can be used to profile microbial communities present in a sample. Here we briefly decribe each method:

### 1.Classify OTUs
- OTUs (Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs)) are clusters of similar sequences and are commonly accepted as analytical units in microbial profiling when using 16S rRNA gene markers.

### 2. Classify Phylotypes
- A phylotype in microbiome research is a DNA sequence or group of sequences sharing more than an arbitrarily chosen level of similarity of a 16S rRNA gene marker.

### 3. Classify ASVs
- ASVs Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASVs)in microbiome research is any inferred single DNA sequences recovered from a bioinformatics analysis of 16S rRNA marker genes.
- ASV is typically really a cluster of sequences that are one or two bases apart from each other.

### 4. Classify Phylogenies
- Microbial phylogenies are from gene sequence homologies.  Models of mutation determine the most-likely evolutionary histories.

## Preliminary OTU analysis using `Mothur`
The preliminary analysis (`alpha_beta_diversity rule`) is part of the bioinformatics analysis. It includes:

- Creating reads count for each group.
- Subsampling for downstream analysis.
- Rarefaction.
- Computing Alpha diversity metrics.
- Computing Beta diversity metrics.
- Getting sample distances.
- Constructing sample phylip tree.
- Generating ordination matrices including PCoA and NMDS.
