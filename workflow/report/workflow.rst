**MOTHUR microbiome bioinformatics snakemake workflow**::

    This workflow performs the following tasks:
    - Assembles and screens the qced reads.
    - Aligns representative sequences to a reference.
    - Denoises and removes chimeras and non-bacterial sequences.
    - Taxonomically, classifies the representative sequences.
    - Cluster OTUs and assign taxonomic names.
    - Generate the OTU table known as shared table in mothur.
    - Calculates sequencing error rate.
    - Computes alpha diversity.
    - Computes beta diversity metrics.
    - computes distances nbetween samples and.
    - Generates Newick tree.
